# Potato Disease Prediction API

This project is a machine learning model served as a FastAPI application. It uses a pre-trained TensorFlow model to predict diseases in potatoes based on images.

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **TensorFlow**: An end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. We used it to load and use our pre-trained model.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: A Python Imaging Library used to open, manipulate, and save many different image file formats.
- **NumPy**: A package for scientific computing with Python. We used it to manipulate our data.
- **Python**: The project is written in Python.
